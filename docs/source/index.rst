bravado documentation
========================

Bravado is a python client library for Swagger 2.0 services.

More information on Swagger can be found `on the Swagger website
<http://swagger.io/>`_

It aims to be a complete replacement to `swagger codegen <https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen>`__.

Features include:

* Dynamically generated client - no code generation needed!

* Synchronous and Asynchronous http clients out of the box.
 
* Strict validations to verify that your Swagger Schema is  `v2.0 <https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md/>`_ compatible.

* Validations on the parameter and response types.

* Request and Response values are handled with Python types (no need to deal with JSON).

* Doc strings are provided for Operations and Models to give more information about the API.

* Local file path to swagger.json is also acceptable.
